-> Form to ask for a course creation


How to create a maze task
====================

->Downloadable folder of a typical task
  
  - Link to an existing course/template (so that they do not lose time waiting for the course creation ?)
        - One or Many tasks giving information like the inginious tutorial course 
        - (number of tasks depend on the amount of information I need to write I guess ? )
        
        

"This tutorial is split in three levels depending on your ability to dive into the code."

Level 1 - Never seen a line of code 
  - Download a premade task, like celine did, nothing to do for the teacher


(Reference to the webdav connection system ?)

Level 2 - Can code a bit / modify the xml ?

 - here much more detail about all the different parameters ?
 
 
Level 3 - Dev, can modify anywhere in the files

 - necessary to have three levels ? (to define as I write it I guess)
